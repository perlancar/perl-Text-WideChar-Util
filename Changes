0.10    2014-02-08  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes.

        - Change CJK regexes from my() to our() so it's usable by other module

        - mbwrap(): Fix bug when truncating long word.

0.08    2013-10-29  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes. Rebuild to resolve 'nested encoding' problem
          causing MetaCPAN to fail to index the dist (thanks Shantanu Bhadoria).


0.07    2013-09-10  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Provide pad() and trunc() which are respectively the non-wide version
          of mbpad() and mbtrunc().

        - Reimplement mbwrap() to be more like Emacs and Text::ANSI::Util's
          behavior.

0.02    2013-04-09  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [BUG FIXES]

        - mbpad(): Since mbtrunc() can generate text with width ($width-1) or
        even less, depending on the width of truncated wide character, we need
        to pad again to get to $width.

        - First release.
