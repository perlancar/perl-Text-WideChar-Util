0.03    2013-04-18 (SHARYANTO)

        - Reimplement mbwrap() to be more like Emacs and Text::ANSI::Util's

        - Provide wrap() as an alternative for Text::Wrap's wrap().

        [BUG FIXES]

        - mbpad(): Since mbtrunc() can generate text with width ($width-1) or
        even less, depending on the width of truncated wide character, we need
        to pad again to get to $width.


0.01    2013-04-09 (SHARYANTO)
